What was I looking for in a blog? Three things. Something that made it easy to
(1) draft blog posts in a familiar language (markdown), (2) put everything into
version control (git), and, most importantly, (3) incorporate {<em title="This string came from rust -> wasm!" className="text-orange-600">{rust_string()}</em>}
components for interactive demos. Yes, that crab string {"<-"} actually comes from rust compiled to WebAssembly\!

This setup will help illustrate the concepts I'll be covering in future posts,
such as an interactive [bevy](https://bevyengine.org) physics sim. I'll walk
through some of the highlights of getting this setup so you too can have a rusty
blog!

# Next.js + React + Typescript = ðŸ’–

While I'm excited about some of the [efforts](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)
going into [rust frontend](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/) dev, I don't
think anything beats the productivity of React + Typescript just yet. Don't
worry, we'll get to the rust later!

The first step is to start with a Nextjs Typescript project.

```bash
yarn create next-app --typescript
```

# MDX

# rust

## Initial Wasm

## Custom Vercel Build

## Config Workaround

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>;
