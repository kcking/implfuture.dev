# Zero to SPA in Full-Stack Rust

> Building a modern web app with Rust, Bazel, Yew and Axum.

Earlier this year I [rewrote my website](/blog/building-a-blog-like-its-2022)
with Next.js, React, tsx, and mdx. Having tried full-stack rust in the past, I
didn't think its developer experience was on par with the Next.js stack. Well
times have changed, and I wanted to see just how far I could push rust to feel
like Next.js. So I did what any developer would do and rewrote my personal
site... again.

## The Destination

This post is a summary of my journey to a full-stack rust web application. I'll
give an overview of how I used Yew and Axum to build a single-page
application (SPA) with server-side rendering (SSR), Hooks (Yew function
components), Markdown with embedded Yew components (MDX), and code syntax
highlighting with Prismjs. The entire build uses Bazel's rust support, including
a local development server, cross-compiling to linux with zig, and assembling a
container image for deployment to a serverless or container runtime.

Let's get started!

## Yew Function Components (Hooks)

When I last rewrote my personal site, I found [React
Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to be an elegant way to write
UI state and render logic. I wanted a similar experience for this rewrite, and was stoked to see Yew now has Hooks, by the name of [Function Components](https://yew.rs/docs/concepts/function-components/introduction).

A function component is a modular UI element represented as a function. The
function takes in parameters (called Props), evaluates any necessary business
logic, sets up interactive callbacks (like `onclick` handlers), and finally
returns an HTML-like rendering of the UI. Function components map onto MVC where
the Props are the model, the function body is the controller, and the return
value is the view.

```rust
// A simple function component
#[function_component]
fn Counter() -> Html {
    //  store an integer count
    let count = use_state(|| 0);
    //  increment on click
    let click = use_callback(|_, [count]| count.set(**count + 1), [count.clone()]);

    html! {
        <button onclick={ click }>
            {"Counter "}{*count}
        </button>
    }
}
```

The above code renders as: <Counter />. It's that easy to create an interactive
component that stores state and responds to input. It's also trivial to compose
them by just adding `<ComponentName />` to the return value of the parent
component.

TODO: show a more on-trivial component, perhaps blog index

## Single-Page Application (SPA) Routing

Now that we've covered the core app logic using function components, the next
piece of the puzzle is how components are organized in a hierarchy.

One advantage of writing an application as a SPA is that the browser does not
"reload" or flash when the user navigates to another page. Instead, when the
user clicks a button or link, local application code on the frontend renders and
replaces the DOM. This also eliminates the latency of requesting a new page from
the server.

Yew comes with SPA support included in the form of
[`yew-router`](https://docs.rs/yew-router). Similar to
[`react-router`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start),
`yew-router` lets you define a hierarchy of application routes, and then map
each route to a specific component. Here's how my website is structured:

```rust
//  My website routes
enum Route {
    #[at("/")]
    Home,
    #[at("/blog")]
    BlogIndex,
    #[at("/blog/:slug")]
    BlogPost { slug: String },
    #[at("/projects")]
    Projects,
}
```

Each variant of the `Route` enum is a different page on my website. The
`#[at(..)]` attribute macro tells Yew what the path of each page should be.
Routes can even have parameters, which I used in the `BlogPost` variant to
specify which post should be rendered.

Here's the (simplified) route-to-component routing logic for this website:

```rust
fn switch(route: Route) -> Html {
    match route {
        Route::Home => html! {
            <h1>{"impl Future {}"}</h1>
        },
        Route::BlogIndex => blog::blog_index(),
        Route::BlogPost{slug} => blog::render(&slug),
        Route::Projects => html! {
            <Projects />
        },
    }
}
```

Since `Route` is a rust enum, I am forced to implement every possible route. If
I were to add another route to the enum, the compiler would error until I also
implement the render logic in this `switch` function. The `BlogIndex` variant
takes advantage of the arbitrary structure of rust enums -- I know that if
`route` is `BlogIndex`, there is also a valid `slug: String` field that was
parsed by `yew-router`.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

SPAs are great but pose a couple of problems:

- The client has to download all of the application code (in this case WASM)
  before the page can be rendered.
- Web crawlers will run a limited amount of code to understand the content of
  your website, resulting in bad Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

Similar issues exist in the React/javascript world, and the most comomn solution
is Server-Side Rendering. Here is the typical SSR flow:

1. The server receives the initial HTTP request from the client
1. The server runs its own copy of the application code on the path of the request
1. The resulting DOM is serialized to a string and injected into the initial HTML response
1. The client immediately renders the initial HTML page and download the application code
1. The client starts the local application which attaches to the initial DOM nodes (also called hydration)

Luckily, Yew has [implemented
both](https://yew.rs/docs/next/advanced-topics/server-side-rendering) the
render-to-string and hydration steps! This just leaves tying it all together
with a web server.

Let's see how we can make this all work with [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum).

The basic logic we need to handle an incoming request is:

1. If the path matches a path in our Yew app, serve `index.html` with first
   render of that page injected into it.
2. Otherwise, try serving a static file from `static/`.

For the first part, we need a tower service that detects whether a path matches
our Yew app, and otherwise calls another fallback service. I couldn't find
anything in axum or tower that would do this out of the box, so I wrote my own
service:

```rust
//  tower service that matches a request to a Yew App route, or falls back to
//  another service (lots of boilerplate omitted)
struct RoutableService<S, F> {
    yew_service: S,
    fallback_service: F,
}

impl <R, S, F> Service for RoutableService
where
    R: yew_router::Routable, S: Service, F: Service,
{
     fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> Self::Future {
        match <R as Routable>::recognize(req.uri().path()).is_some() {
            //  if request path matches Yew route, serve S
            true => self.yew_service.call(req),
            //  else serve F
            false => self.fallback_service.call(req),
        }
    }
}
```

For the full version, check it out [on
GitHub](https://github.com/kcking/implfuture.dev/blob/814f23dfa63065368dae0ba5e8f348592a8ae20d/server/src/main.rs#L113).

With a Yew-route-aware service, everything can now be pulled together:

```rust
fn yew_ssr(req: Request) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let props = ServerAppProps {
        path: url.uri().path().to_owned().into(),
        queries,
    };
    let mut out = String::new();
    yew::ServerRenderer::<implfuture::ServerApp>::with_props(props)
        .render_to_string(&mut out)
        .await;
    //  index.html contents read at compile-time, with first render injected
    //  into <body>
    INDEX_HTML.replace("<body>", &format!("<body>{}", out));
}

//  static files like wasm, js, images, and css
let static_serve = tower_http::ServeDir::new("static");

//  Try Yew app first, fall-back to static files.
let serve = RoutableService {
    yew_service: yew_ssr,
    fallback_service: static_serve,
};
```

## MDX

While Yew's `html!` macro is great for writing small components, writing a blog
post out by hand would be painstaking. I loved using MDX with embedded
typescript React components in my last website rewrite, and wanted to bring the
same experience to rust/yew.

I added an [`mdx!` macro](https://github.com/kcking/yew/blob/mdx/packages/yew-macro/src/mdx/mod.rs) to the `yew_macro` crate which lets me write

````rust
mdx! {r#"
    # Title
    A list of things:
    - thing One
    - thing Two
    ```rust
    // rust code block
    fn main() {}
    ```
"#}
````

instead of the equivalent `html!` syntax:

```rust
html! {
    <h1> {"Title"} </h1>
    <p>{"A list of things:"}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>{"thing One"}</li>
        <li>{"thing Two"}</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>
    // rust code block
    fn main() {}
    </code></pre>
}
```

> Note: the string literal wrapper in `mdx!` is a work-around to have a
> whitespace-sensitive proc-macro. If anyone knows a cleaner alternative let me
> know!

The `mdx!` proc-macro is a Markdown frontend to the `yew::html!` macro. It uses
the [`pulldown-cmark`](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark) crate to convert `#` to
`<h1></h1>`, \`\` to `<code></code>`, and so on.

Yew components can be embedded with their usual html syntax:

```rust
fn MyComponent() { html! {<p>{"Component"}</p>}}

mdx! {r#"
    <Component />
"#}
```

I also added support for replacing all instances of an element with a custom Yew
component. For example, all header tags on my blog are labelled with an `id`
based on their text and are turned into clickable links.

```rust
mdx_style!(
    h1: MyH1,
);

fn MyH1(c: &ChildProps) -> Html {
    let slug = /* turn header text into string */;
    html! {
        //  Make all headers deeplink-able
        <a href={format!("#{slug}")}>
            <h1 id={tag}>
                {c.children.clone()}
            </h1>
        </a>
    }
}
```

To top it off, I added an `include_mdx!` macro to parse an external Markdown
file from rust code. This lets me write Markdown with all of the usual IDE
support, and without the `r#""#` wrapper.

```markdown
blog.mdx

# Blog Post

> Subtitle
```

```rust
fn blog() -> Html {
    include_mdx!("blog.mdx")
}
```
